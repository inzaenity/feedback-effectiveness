# feedback-effectiveness

## Abstract
Using Machine learning models to evaluate and give feedback for the effectiveness of argumentative writing. 
The goal is to classify a text as Ineffective, Adequate, Effective given its discourse lead, Position, Claim, Evidence, Counterclaim, Rebuttal and Concluding Statement.

For this project I explore Traditional Algorithms and CNNs
 * Explore four popular machine learning algorithms, namely logistic regression, multinomial naive Bayes, kNN and decision trees.
 * Explore of Convolutional Neural Networks.
